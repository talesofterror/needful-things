Pulseaudio is configurable. To find out, which sources you have you could issue:

pactl list short sinks

Then you might get something like:

alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo  module-alsa-card.c  s16le 2ch 44100Hz   SUSPENDED s16le 2ch 44100Hz SUSPENDED

To set a certain output as default (your choice from the list above):

pacmd set-default-sink alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo

To persist it put that line into /etc/pulse/default.pato have it across reboots
