USEFUL FFMPEG COMMANDS


Extract audio from video 

ffmpeg -i input-video.avi -vn -acodec copy output-audio.aac 

Save frames to file

ffmpeg -i <filename>_%04d.png <newfilename>.gif 

Save GIF with pallete, at 20 frames per second

ffmpeg -i input.gif -vf "fps=20,split[s0][s1];[s0]palettegen[p];[s1][p]paletteuse" output.gif
	- change to "paletteuse=dither=<dithering type>" 
	- this example uses -vf, which I'm pretty sure stands for "videofilter" 
		which uses a string to set properties of the videofilter
	- splits the workload into two streams within videofilter: [s0] and [s1]
	- [s0] calls the "palettegen" command and sends it to [p]
	- [s1] takes the [p] value and puts it into the "paletteuse" command
	- "paletteuse" normally called by using the -lavfi flag, which I know nothing of 
	- complicated command that I don't fully understand
