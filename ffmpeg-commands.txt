USEFUL FFMPEG COMMANDS

~~~

EXTRACT AUDIO FROM VIDEO 

ffmpeg -i input-video.avi -vn -acodec copy output-audio.aac 

**

REPLACE AUDIO IN VIDEO

ffmpeg -i v.mp4 -i a.wav -c:v copy -map 0:v:0 -map 1:a:0 new.mp4

**

REMOVE AUDIO FROM FILE

ffmpeg -i in -c copy -an out
	Take a video [in], copies it's content and skips the inclusion of the audio
	stream. 

**

SAVE FRAMES TO FILE

ffmpeg -i <filename>_%04d.png <newfilename>.gif 

**

CONCAT FRAMES IN REVERSE

	- for a video with no audio, do:

ffmpeg -i in -filter_complex "[0:v]reverse,fifo[r];[0:v][r] concat
	=n=2:v=1 [v]" -map "[v]" out

	- to do the same for a video with audio, do:

ffmpeg -i in -filter_complex "[0:v]reverse,fifo[r];[0:v][0:a][r] [0:a]
	concat=n=2:v=1:a=1 [v] [a]" -map "[v]" -map "[a]" out

SAVE GIF WITH PALLETE, AT 20 FRAMES PER SECOND

ffmpeg -i input.gif -vf "fps=20,split[s0][s1];[s0]palettegen[p];[s1][p]paletteuse" output.gif
	- change to "paletteuse=dither=<dithering type>" 
	- this example uses -vf, which I'm pretty sure stands for "videofilter" 
		which uses a string to set properties of the videofilter
	- splits the workload into two streams within videofilter: [s0] and [s1]
	- [s0] calls the "palettegen" command and sends it to [p]
	- [s1] takes the [p] value and puts it into the "paletteuse" command
	- "paletteuse" normally called by using the -lavfi flag, which I know nothing of 
	- complicated command that I don't fully understand

CLIPPING A VIDEO AT CERTAIN TIMES (COPIED FROM STACK OVERFLOW, USER RGOV)

ffmpeg -ss 30 -i input.wmv -c copy -t 10 output.wmv
	In the above command, the timestamps are in seconds (s.msec), but 
	timestamps can also be in HH:MM:SS.xxx format. The following is equivalent:
ffmpeg -ss 00:00:30.0 -i input.wmv -c copy -t 00:00:10.0 output.wmv
	Note that -t is an output option and always needs to be specified after -i.
	Some tips:
	For older ffmpeg versions, if you use -ss after -i, you get more accurate 
	seeking at the expense of a slower execution altogether. See also: Seeking 
	with FFmpeg

	You can use -to instead of -t to specify the timestamp to which you want to 
	cut. So, instead of -i <input> -ss 30 -t 10 you could also do 
	-i <input> -ss 30 -to 40 to achieve the same thing.

	If your ffmpeg does not support -c, or -to, it is likely very outdated. 
	Compile a new version yourself or download a static build from their 
	homepage. It's really not complicated.

OFFSET FRAMES TO MAINTAIN SEAMLESS LOOP 

ffmpeg -i in -vf "split=2[a][b];[a]trim=start_frame=20,setpts=N/FR/TB[a];
[b]trim=end_frame=20,setpts=N/FR/TB[b];[a][b]concat" out
	I found this in a youtube video and have no idea if it works.

SAVE IMAGES WITH ALPHA USING ALPHA CAPABLE VIDEO CODEC (AVI)

ffmpeg -i in -vcodec qtrle out.mov
ffmpeg -i in -vcodec ffvhuff out.avi
ffmpeg -i in -vcodec huffyyuv out.avi
	Seems to work
