	NAND

	if both inputs are off, it is on
	if either input is on, it is on
	if both inputs are on, it is off

	In our NOR exercise, 


	You can get from any basic gate to any other, at most you have to NOT both inputs and output. 

	You can go between OR/NOR by inverting output. The same goes for AND?NAND. In fact NOR means
	NOT OR and NAND means NOT AND. Notice the component shape of OR/NOR are identical except for
	the little got at the tip which means NOT. AND/NAND are also identical except for this dot. 

	Negating the output glips all the bits in the last row of the truth table. Negating the inputs 
	mirrors the last row of the truth table.
