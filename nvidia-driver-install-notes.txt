This section includes instructions for installing the NVIDIA driver on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS distributions using the package manager.

The NVIDIA driver requires that the kernel headers and development packages for the running version of the kernel be installed at the time of the driver installation, as well whenever the driver is rebuilt. For example, if your system is running kernel version 4.4.0, the 4.4.0 kernel headers and development packages must also be installed.

The kernel headers and development packages for the currently running kernel can be installed with:

$ sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)

Install the CUDA repository public GPG key. This can be done via the cuda-keyring package or a manual installation of the key. The usage of apt-key is deprecated.

$ distribution=$(. /etc/os-release;echo $ID$VERSION_ID | sed -e 's/\.//g')

$ wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/$distribution/x86_64/cuda-keyring_1.0-1_all.deb

$ sudo dpkg -i cuda-keyring_1.0-1_all.deb

Update the APT repository cache and install the driver using the cuda-drivers meta-package. Use the --no-install-recommends option for a lean driver install without any dependencies on X packages. This is particularly useful for headless installations on cloud instances.

$ sudo apt-get update

$ sudo apt-get -y install cuda-drivers

Follow the post-installation steps in the CUDA Installation Guide for Linux to setup environment variables, NVIDIA persistence daemon (recommended) and to verify the successful installation of the driver.
